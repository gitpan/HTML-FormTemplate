	* Release 1.02.
	
	* This release is the first one following official registrations with 
	"The Perl 5 Module List".  The updated entry would look like this:
	
HTML::
::FormTemplate    adpO Store definition, make persist forms, report DUNCAND
	
	* This release contains my "HTML::FormTemplate" module, which was previously 
	a part of the following distributions under the temporary name of 
	"HTML::FormMaker": 
		- "libdwg": v1.0 r2000-07-23, v1.11 r2000-08-23
		- "CGI-FormGenerator": v0.9 r2000-09-04, v0.9201 r2000-12-26
	
	* This module requires Perl version 5.004 (although 5.0 may work).
	It also requires HTML::EasyTags 1.02, and CGI::MultiValuedHash 1.03.

	* Code changes since HTML::FormMaker consist mainly in accounting for 
	changes to the other modules that this one uses.  Its public interface is 
	mostly unchanged.  What did change is that user input and field definitions 
	can now be passed in any format that CGI::MultiValuedHash can understand as 
	an initializer.  Also, the inherited start_html() and end_html() methods no 
	longer exist as they were gratuitious.
	
	* The POD also received significant updates, particlularly in the Synopsis 
	and "Parameters by Field Type" sections.
