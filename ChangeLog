	* Release 1.05.
	
	* This release is the first one that includes the CPAN standard files 
	"Makefile.PL", "test.pl", and "MANIFEST", which were all created following 
	the previous release.  The content of "Manifest" was previously inside the 
	"ReadMe" file.  Improved the install instructions in my ReadMe file.

	* Note that "test.pl" is incomplete; it only tests that this module will 
	compile but not that the methods work; it is included so that people can use 
	the Makefile in the standard way during installation.  "test.pl" will be 
	fleshed out during major release 2.0 of this module, coming soon.
	
	* This class now requires Class::ParamParser 1.03, HTML::EasyTags 1.0301, 
	Data::MultiValuedHash 1.06, and CGI::MultiValuedHash 1.06.  I consider the 
	first three modules to be stable and well tested, as well as unlikely to 
	change.  The fourth module is partially tested, but production use of the 
	other functionality finds it to be working properly.

	* Release 1.04.
	
	* This release is entirely to maintain compatability with HTML::EasyTags 
	1.03, which is a parent class.  Specifically, one of the class properties 
	and its associated accessor method, positional_by_default(), was removed from
	HTML::EasyTags because it was no longer needed there.  However, since some 
	methods of HTML::FormTemplate do use this property, it and the associated 
	method has been added to HTML::FormTemplate itself.

	* This class now requires versions 1.03 each of Class::ParamParser and 
	HTML::EasyTags, so you will need to have them installed.  Note that I 
	consider those two releases to be complete and stable, so they are unlikely 
	to be changed in the forseeable future.

	* Release 1.03.
	
	* This release is entirely for fixing bugs in the coding and the POD.
	
	* Fixed bug where providing a Hash ref as a "labels" parameter for 
	radio/field groups doesn't work (acts like explicit labels not provided and 
	uses values as labels).  Fixed a similar bug that afflicted the "defaults"
	parameter.  This is the last of the "bugs" that I know of.
	
	* Fixed bugs in POD that caused display problems with it, including:
		- Description section too long; now split into itself and Overview.
		- Ensured a blank line between Synopsis and Description.
		- Likewise between "HTML Code..." and "Field Types...".
		- Changed several bulleted lists whose first word of text was boldfaced 
		into numbered lists; before, some strangeness caused all the text of the 
		bulleted lists to be boldfaced and in one paragraph and/or strangely 
		indented in CPAN's HTML version; these should be fixed.
	
	* Thanks to Geir Johannessen <geir.johannessen@nextra.com> for alerting me to 
	several obscure bugs in my POD (the first three); these only showed up when 
	manifying, whereas MacPerl's Shuck and CPAN's HTMLizer rendered it properly.

	* Release 1.02.
	
	* This release is the first one following official registrations with 
	"The Perl 5 Module List".  The updated entry would look like this:
	
HTML::
::FormTemplate    adpO Store definition, make persist forms, report DUNCAND
	
	* This release contains my "HTML::FormTemplate" module, which was previously 
	a part of the following distributions under the temporary name of 
	"HTML::FormMaker": 
		- "libdwg": v1.0 r2000-07-23, v1.11 r2000-08-23
		- "CGI-FormGenerator": v0.9 r2000-09-04, v0.9201 r2000-12-26
	
	* This module requires Perl version 5.004.
	It also requires HTML::EasyTags 1.02, and CGI::MultiValuedHash 1.03.

	* Code changes since HTML::FormMaker consist mainly in accounting for 
	changes to the other modules that this one uses.  Its public interface is 
	mostly unchanged.  What did change is that user input and field definitions 
	can now be passed in any format that CGI::MultiValuedHash can understand as 
	an initializer.  Also, the inherited start_html() and end_html() methods no 
	longer exist as they were gratuitious.
	
	* The POD also received significant updates, particlularly in the Synopsis 
	and "Parameters by Field Type" sections.
	
2000-12-26   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* CGI-FormGenerator 0.9201, the last version of any distribution to include
HTML::FormMaker, was released.
	
2000-07-23   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* libdwg 1.0, the first version of any distribution to include
HTML::FormMaker, was released on CPAN.
	
2000-04-21   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Completed primary development on this module.

2000-01-30   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

	* Began development on the final version of this module.
	
	* Module based on a template created by h2xs 1.18.

1999-07 thru 1999-12

	* Worked on second prototype of code that ended up in this module.

1999-02 thru 1999-05

	* Created first prototypes of code that ended up in this module, which were 
	used in a production environment as part of modules dedicated to doing 
	either e-mail forms or guest books or threaded discussion boards.
